		"startIntroPart1": "All Hail King Tamar of Georgia! You rule Georgia, a nation of poets, priests and warriors perched among the ferocious peaks of the Caucasus mountains. Though ruling in unelightened times and facing a rebellious nobility chafing under their own misogyny, you inspired devotion and loyalty among the people of Georgia and crushed those who refused to acknowledge your rule. With the nation bent to your pious will, you went on to lead the small mountain kingdom onto epic conquests, uniting the Caucasus mountains and destroying Muslim neighbours vastly larger than your shining beacon of Christianity. Smashing even the mighty Seljuk empire, Georgia became a regional hegemon - even as far as Jerusalem, Georgian priests went unmolested by their heathen countrymen, while Georgian knights rode unmolested, banners unfurled, striking georgian colors through the ancient city, a rare honour for even the mightiest of empires.",
